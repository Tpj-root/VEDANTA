```
கற்றது கையளவு கல்லாதது உலகளவு
உடம்பு நான் இல்லை  மனசு நான் இல்லை என்பதை உணர்ந்து ஆசைகள் பயங்களைத் துறந்தால் நீயும் கடவுளை உணரலாம்.
```




### Find Who's???
```
Whoever's doing this,it's personal to them.

You can't run, you can't hide.

The only way out is to find out who it is

and get them before they get you.
```






```
Don't think you know you are







Do not try and bend the spoon.
That's impossible.
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

What truth?

There is no spoon.
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.






Do you think you are the One?
I don't know.

You know what that means?
It's Latin.
Means, "Know thyself."

I'll let you in on a little secret.

Being the One is just
like being in love.

No one can tell you you're in love.

You just know it ... 
 ... through and through.
 Balls to bones.






No one has ever done
anything like this.

That's why it's going to work.




```



```

Fear is the path to the dark side.
Fear leads to anger. 
Anger leads to hate.
Hate leads to suffering.

I sense much fear in you.


```







```

 Gautama Buddha

    Go forward without a path,
    Fearing nothing, caring for nothing!
    Wandering alone, like the rhinoceros!
    Even as a lion, not trembling at noises,
    Even as the wind, not caught in the net,
    Even as the lotus leaf, untainted by water,
    Do thou wander alone, like the rhinoceros!


```
